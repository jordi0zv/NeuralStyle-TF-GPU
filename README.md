# NeuralStyle-TF-GPU

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique in machine learning and compute vision that allows the fusion of two images: One representing the content and the other the style. The result is a new image (generated image) that combines the content structure with the artistic features of the style image.

This project implements NST using Tensorflow with GPU acceleration via CUDA, leveraging the VGG19 pre-trained model for feature extraction.
